# Bluetooth-Controlled-Car
As in the circuit diagram, we assemble our car and upload our code to the arduino. For the car to start, data needs to come from the Bluetooth module. This data will come from smartphones or tablets with Bluetooth. First of all, we need to pair our devices with the Bluetooth module. For this, we download our application from the link below.
